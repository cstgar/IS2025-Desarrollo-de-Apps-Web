    <!--HTML Image Maps-->
    <!--
    With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.
    Image Maps
    The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.
    Try to click on the computer, phone, or the cup of coffee in the image below:
    -->

    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" width="400" height="379">
    <map name="workmap">
        <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3images/mac.jpg">
        <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3images/cellphone.jpg">
        <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Cup of coffee" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3images/coffeehouse2.jpg">
    </map>

    <!--How Does it Work?
    The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different 
    actions depending on where in the image you click.
    To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that 
    describes the clickable areas.
    The Image
    The image is inserted using the <img> tag. 
    The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute
    The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, 
    and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.
    Tip: You can use any image as an image map!

    Create Image Map
    Then, add a <map> element.
    The <map> element is used to create an image map, 
    and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute.
    The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute .  

    The Areas
    Then, add the clickable areas.
    A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.
    Shape
    You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:
        - rect - defines a rectangular region
        - circle - defines a circular region
        - poly - defines a polygonal region
        - default - defines the entire region
    You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image. - 
    
    Shape rect
    The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and 
    one for the y-axis.
    So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin 
    and 44 pixels from the top. (punto en esquina superior izquierda donde se encuentra la computadora en la imagen)
    The coordinates 270,350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin 
    and 350 pixels from the top (punto en esquina inferior derecha donde se encuentar la computadora en la imagen)
    Now we have enough data to create a clickable rectangular area:
        <area shape="rect" coords="34, 44, 270, 350" href="computer.htm">
        This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "computer.htm":

    <br>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/a6hUCYP.png" alt="clickable area">


    <!-- Shape Circle
     To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle: 337,300
     Then specify the radius of the circle: 44 pixels
     Now you have enough data to create a clickable circular area:
    -->
    <h5>Shape Circle</h5>
    <p>Primero verifica el centro del circulo. Despues, especifica el radio del circulo en pixeles</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VroYbg1.png" alt="center of circle"><br>
    <p>Se tiene un area clickeable</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Pb0TdpW.png" alt="especifica el radio del circulo en pixeles">

    <!--Shape Poly
    The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).
    This can be used to create any shape.
    Like maybe a croissant shape!
    How can we make the croissant in the image below become a clickable link?
    We have to find the x and y coordinates for all edges of the croissant:
    -->
    <h5>Shape Poly</h5>
    <p>
        The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).
        How can we make the croissant in the image below become a clickable link?  
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/frenchfood.jpg" alt="croissant">
    <p>We have to find the x and y coordinates for all edges of the croissant:</p>
    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/frenchfood4.jpg" alt="find x and y coordenadas para todos las fronteras del croissant">
    <p>The coordinates come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis:</p>
    <blockquote>
        area shape="poly" coords="140,121,181,116,204,160,204,222,191,270,140,329,85,355,58,352,37,322,40,259,103,161,128,147" href="croissant.htm"
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is the area that becomes clickable and will send the user to the page "croissant.htm":</p>
    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/frenchfood3.jpg" alt="clickable">

    <!--Image Map and JavaScript
    A clickable area can also trigger a JavaScript function.
    Add a click event to the <area> element to execute a JavaScript function:
    Ejemplo:
        <map name="workmap">
            <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" href="coffee.htm" onclick="myFunction()">
        </map>
        <script>
        function myFunction() {
            alert("You clicked the coffee cup!");
        }
        </script>
    -->
